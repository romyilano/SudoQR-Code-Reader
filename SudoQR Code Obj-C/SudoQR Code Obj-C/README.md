# Objective-C QR Code Reader

This is more or less line by line initially from an appcode blog post 
* [link](http://www.appcoda.com/qr-code-ios-programming-tutorial/)

I'm adding copious comments. Feel free to ask me or other SudoRoom folks
how to read this, some people have issues with Objective-C syntax
* Obj C uses messaging versus methods, looks more like SmallTalk. I can do a crash course if you want.

hoping to convert this to Swift later (which should be easy) since non Obj C people find it easier to read.
